# k-means-Clustering-Final-Project 
Final Project for CSC 535 Data Mining  
k-means Clustering Algorithm made from scratch  
Created with Python/Jupyter Notebook

## Database
Data Science and STEM Salaries  
https://www.kaggle.com/jackogozaly/data-science-and-stem-salaries  

This dataset contains useful information such as education level, compensation (base salary, bonus, stock grants), race, and more.  
More than 62,000 salary records from top companies.  

## Procedure
1. Dataset reduced to only numerical attributes
2. Data scaled and normalized to Gaussian distribution
3. Dimensions of data reduced with Principle Component Analysis
4. Find optimal k-value with Elbow Graph
5. Run data through k-means algorithm to cluster similar entries
6. Plot data before and after clustering has taken place
7. Resulting data plotted with boxplots for each attribute and are grouped by cluster
